# Quick Reaction - Logistics Management

A Mobile Sensor Cloud Solution to efficiently manage the logistics operation using sensors. 

The user interface is designed using html, css, javascript, php and shieldUI plugin. All data was stored in MySQL and the application was deployed on AWS and hosted on Bluehost.

We also wrote a script that mocks sensors by sending different types of sensor data constantly.
